# BHLunchEvent
I have created the project in UI5 and deployed the project in my trial cloud accout, here is the Link: https://bhevent-i339228trial.dispatcher.hanatrial.ondemand.com/index.html?hc_reset 

How to Execute:
If you open the given link in debugger mode, change the next line (line No. 16) 
var eventList = this.matchLunchEvent(Events), with passing the event object as parameter and then execute the file.


Project is the BHEvent Folder, under webapp. There all the files can be found which is needed to run the file.

As I used UI5 I cannot replicate the UI has given in the pdf, but I tried to keep the functionalities same.
